SUBJECT OUTLINE 
36106 Machine Learning Algorithms and Applications 
Spring 2024
Subject description 
This subject   introduces students to key machine   learning algorithms   and   their   application   in   real-world   settings.
Participants are guided in developing an   intuitive   understanding of   how   the   algorithms work,   as well   as   their   strengths         and weaknesses.   In addition to gaining practical experience with the algorithms,   students   develop   an   understanding   of   the basic principles of machine learning   and   the   connections   between   different   algorithms.   Additionally,   they   are
exposed to   industry standard methodologies for data mining and   analytics   via   readings   and   assessments.   Since   data   science   problems are   infused with assumptions, often with ethical and   legal   implications, due   attention   is   given to
questioning the assumptions behind data and approaches   used to   analyse   it.
Subject learning objectives (SLOs) 
Upon successful completion of this subject students should be   able   to:
1. Apply an industry standard analytics lifecycle   methodology for data   mining   and   pattern   discovery
2.   Interpret, synthesise and communicate insights extracted from   machine   learning   algorithms   in   a   context-appropriate manner.
3. Articulate the strengths, weaknesses and assumptions of a selection of machine   learning   algorithms   in   relation   to   structured and unstructured   data
4.   Execute and interpret machine learning   approaches   available for   extracting value   from   data
5. Demonstrate an appreciation, with examples, of a   critical, ethical   perspective   on   decisions   made   throughout   the   analytics lifecycle
Course intended learning outcomes (CILOs) 
This subject also contributes specifically to the development of the following   course   outcomes:
. Making predictions and informing data discovery 
Analyse the value of different models, established assumptions and   generalisations,   about the   behaviour   of   particular systems, for making predictions and informing   data   discovery   investigations   (1.3)
Exploring, interpreting and visualising data 
Explore, analyse, manipulate, interpret and visualise data   using   data   science   techniques,   software   and   technologies to make sense   of data   rich environments   (2.2)
. Designing and managing data investigations Apply and assess data science concepts, theories,   practices and tools   for   designing   and   managing   data   discovery   investigations   in   professional environments that draw upon diverse data   sources,   including   efforts to   shed   light   on      underrepresented components (2.4)

Explore, interrogate, generate, apply, test and evaluate   problem-solving   strategies to   extract   economic,   business,   social, strategic or other value from data   (3.1)
Examining and articulating data value 
Critically examine the perceived value of data analytics outcomes   and   clearly   articulate   implications for   different   stakeholders and organisations (3.2)
Working together 
Develop a collaborative and team-oriented mindset to   harness value for   stakeholders   to   produce   innovative   solutions to challenges   (3.3)
Engaging audiences 
Explore and craft   interpretative   narratives that engage key audiences with   data   analytics   and   potential   significance   for action, at a societal, industrial, organisational,   group   or   individual   levels   (4.2)
· Informing decision making 
Develop, test, justify and deliver data project propositions,   methodologies, analytics   outcomes   and
recommendations for informing decision-making, both to specialist and   non-specialist   audiences   (4.3)
Becoming a reflective data practitioner 
Engage   in active, reflective practice that supports flexible   navigation   of assumptions,   alternatives   and   uncertainty   in   professional data science contexts   (5.1)
Contribution to the development of graduate attributes 
Your experiences as a student in this subject   support   you   to   develop   the following   graduate   attributes   (GA):
GA   1 Sociotechnical systems thinking
GA 2 Creative, analytical and   rigorous sense   making   GA 3 Create value   in   problem solving   and   inquiry
GA 4   Persuasive and robust communication   GA 5   Ethical citizenship
Teaching and learning strategies 
Blend of online and face to face activities: This subject   is offered   through   a   series   of   block   sessions   and   blends   online with face-to-face learning. Students participate in   interactive   learning   experiences   in   timetabled   on-campus      sessions, where they   make use of the subject materials that they   have   already   engaged   with   online.   In   between
campus sessions, students will engage in individual   and   collaborative   online   activities   designed to   support   the   understanding of the machine learning algorithms and their   application   in   real-world   settings
Collaborative work: A strong emphasis is placed   on   group   activities   and   interaction,   given   that   graduates   of this   course will   need to approach professional projects and   challenges from   a   collaborative   and   consensus   position.         Insights obtained and developed within the groups is then   reworked   by   individual   students   to   develop   the   final
summative assessment activity. Group assessments and activities   enable   students to   leverage   peer-learning   and   demonstrate effective skills associated with the topics covered in   this   subject.
Transdisciplinary approaches: Starting from an elemental perspective on   data   and   data   science,   students   will
approach learning from their specific professional and   potential future   contexts. As the   subject   progresses,   the   students will be able to combine their analytical and   technical   skills   in   developing   and   applying   various
machine-learning algorithms, as well as to consider standards and   ethical   implications   of their work.
An aim of this subject is to help you develop academic and professional language and communication skills in order to succeed at university and in the workplace. To determine your current   academic   language   proficiency,   one of the assessment tasks   in this subject will be   used to   assess your   level   of academic   English   language.   If you
receive an unsatisfactory level for English   language,   you 代 写36106 Machine Learning Algorithms and Applications Spring 2024Python

These activities are designed   to   support   you   to   develop   your   language   and   communication skills. Students who   do   not attend 80% of the language   development   activities   will   receive   a   Fail   X   grade   for   the   subject.
